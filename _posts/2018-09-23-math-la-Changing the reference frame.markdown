### Basis is a set of n vectors that :
+ are not linear combinations of each other (linearly independent)
+ span the space (the space is then n-dimensional)

What does it mean for a vector b3 to be linearly independent to the vectors b1, b2
+ b3 does not lie in the plane spanned by b1 and b2
+ b3 is not a1xb1 + b2xb2 for any a1 or a2.


+ Changing basis means Changing the space.
